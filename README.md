# Bikesharing
# Overview of the statistical analysis:

# Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis was to use Tableau to create visualization to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We have used the data from Citibike program using one of the files from Citibike trip data in NYC, particularly August 2019. We have used the data from August because there is likely more traffic during the summer months. 

We will use the datatype to create a set of visualization to: 

•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.

•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

•	Show the top starting locations of bikers riding these bikes in the map. 

•	Show the average trip duration vs the birth year.

# Results:

1.	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout-times-Users.PNG).

Checkout time for Users by minutes. Mostly riders trip duration would be less than 20 mins. The riders become less and less as the trip duration increases.

2.	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders by genders.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout-time-by-Gender.PNG).

Checkout time by Gender. We can see that it is mostly males who ride these bikes compare to the females. There could be many reasons as to why there are mostly males renting out these bikes. 

3.	Show the number of bike trips for all riders each hour of each day of the week.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trip-by-Weekday.PNG).

Trips by Weekday. The representation of the heatmap is correct. Mainly riders ride their bikes during 5-7PM. Darker colour of the heatmap represents a greater number of riders. 

4.	 Show the number of bike trips for all riders by genders for each hour of each day of the week.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips-by-Gender.PNG).

Trips by Gender by weekday. Similarly, if we are evaluating by data, there are more males that are riding these bikes compare to the females. Darker colour in this represents the number of riders by gender.

5.	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Users-Trips-by-Gender-by-Weekday.PNG).

Users’ trips by gender by weekday. As shown in the heatmap, there are mostly subscribers who are likely to use these bikes. Darker colour of heatmap represents the most bike riders.

6.	Show the top starting locations of bikers riding these bikes in the map.

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Average-Trip-Duration.PNG).

Average Trip Duration: We can see mostly younger generation (1970 and up) are the ones using bikes for a longer period. 

7.	Show the average trip duration vs the birth year. 

![bikesharing](https://github.com/Zainak94/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top_Starting_Locations.PNG).

This map indicates the popularity of the bike riders. There might be more tourists in the area that is why there are many riders. Locations matter a lot when it comes to bike riding. 

# Summary:

Overall, the NYC Citibike Analysis represents that there are numerous amounts of people who would be interested in riding bikes as shown. There are more males bike riders compare to the females. We can see that the data represents time of the year as well, bike riding can only be done in summer months. Users who ride these bikes are mainly subscribers, but regular customers rent out these bikes as well. The trip duration is not too long, mostly is less than 20 minutes but there are some people riding for longer. Bikers are usually riding these bikes in the evening time between 5-7pm. The best repair time is before 5am. 

Additional visualization: 
We can use BikeID to identify the bikes who have been ridden more requires more bike repairs. 

## Bike Repairs:

## Bike Utilization:

Similarly, we can use bikeID to check for utilization compare to their trip duration to see which bikes have been utilized more. This can check their efficiency as well

Utilization can help with the repairs as well.
